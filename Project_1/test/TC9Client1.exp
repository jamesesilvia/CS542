#!./expect -f 

#PREREQUISITES AND ASSUMPTIONS:
#all testing is done through putty
#there is already a server started manually in another putty instance
#command to start server is "./server" from the build folder
# (*important*) server and client are both on the same CCCWORK machine
#this script is run concurrently with other scripts on other clients, the scripts for Client1, Client2, and Client3 all need to be run simultaneously

#SUCCESS CRITERIA:
#server shows commands from client
#Client1 shows a series of removes
#Client2 shows a series of puts and gets
#Client3 shows a series of puts and gets
#Console output and data stored in files must be consistent, a get after a remove should fail, for instance
#Server displays order of operations and clients display result of those operations

#assume Client 3 is putting and getting data
#assume Client 2 is putting and getting data

sleep 5

#start the client
spawn ./../build/client localhost

#remove existing data
#this may throw a read failed error if there is no existing data
#this is expected, we're just cleaning up what we intend to use
