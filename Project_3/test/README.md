# Test Results
A Value Store with Indexing and Query Execution

The results from our application are labeled *.results.

The results from the actual SQL queries are located in SQL_Query_Results.xlsx.

Our testing methodology was crude, but effective for Project 3. 

We compared the results from our application to the results of the SQL Query with the same database loaded.

We tested from 10-100 percent; verifying all of the results (including 40%!).

0 percent was not included due to size.
