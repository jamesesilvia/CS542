#!./expect -f 

#PREREQUISITES AND ASSUMPTIONS:
#all testing is done through putty
#there is already a server started manually in another putty instance
#command to start server is "./server" from the build folder
#server and client are both on the same CCCWORK machine
#Database.txt in build folder is deleted before running test
#Run this just after TC6PutManyRecords.exp from a different client

#SUCCESS CRITERIA:
#server shows command from client
#client shows 2000 entries of Attleboro with population of 5000, assuming the other client is finished by then

#start the client
spawn ./../build/client localhost

#put new data
